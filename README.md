# Failure_prediction_with_Keras
This is a very simple network . I approached this ML problem with Keras-Tensorflow approach, as I am a Deep Learning engineer and I approach everything from a data driven problem:)
No overfitting was observed here, so my train/test/val split was fine. The model predicted with great accuracy. This is also can be all compiled and hand tailored in tensorflow with tensorboard, I can show that flow as well if needed:)
Here the algorithm has KerasAPI as the wrapper aroun f tf flow 
thank you
